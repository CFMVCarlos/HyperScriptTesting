# HyperScriptTesting

## Overview
**HyperScriptTesting** is a sandbox project for experimenting with **HyperScript**, a lightweight scripting language designed to make web development more expressive and interactive. This project demonstrates how HyperScript can simplify tasks like DOM manipulation, event handling, and animations directly within HTML.

## Features
This project showcases various **HyperScript** functionalities, including:
- Array manipulation: Log, modify, and iterate through arrays.
- String handling: Concatenate, format, and log strings dynamically.
- Conditional rendering: Display elements based on conditions.
- Attribute manipulation: Update or increment attributes dynamically.
- Event handling: Respond to user interactions such as clicks, key presses, and mouse movements.
- Custom events: Trigger and listen to custom events.
- Animations and transitions: Smoothly transition styles or toggle visibility.
- DOM measurements: Retrieve element dimensions and positions.
- Behavior definitions: Modularize interactive behaviors for reuse.

### Highlighted Examples
1. **Button Toggles**: Change styles, toggle visibility, or toggle classes on button clicks.
2. **Custom Events**: Trigger custom events and display responses.
3. **Array Operations**: Random selection, first/last item access, and iteration over arrays.
4. **Dynamic Attributes**: Increment or manipulate attributes like `data-counter` and `placeholder`.
5. **ContentEditable Mutation Handling**: Monitor and count changes to contenteditable elements.
6. **Element Removal**: Remove elements dynamically and adjust related elements.
7. **Real-Time Filtering**: Filter and display list items based on user input.
8. **Timed Transitions**: Queue animations and transitions for seamless effects.

## Installation
To set up the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/CFMVCarlos/HyperScriptTesting.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd HyperScriptTesting
    ```

## Usage
1. Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.
2. Interact with the various examples on the page to see **HyperScript** in action.
3. Experiment with the code in the `<script>` tag or add new scripts to explore additional **HyperScript** capabilities.

## Requirements
- A modern web browser that supports JavaScript.
- An internet connection to load the HyperScript library from its CDN.
